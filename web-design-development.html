                                    At Creative Work Logic, we build websites that not only look beautiful—but work beautifully. With over 30 years in
                                    programming, design, and server administration, we understand that a website needs to do more than just exist. It needs
                                    to perform. Fast. Securely. Intuitively.<br>
                                    <br>
                                     What We Offer<br>
                                    <br>

                                     Bespoke visuals crafted to match your brand identity. Logo, color palette, typography, image style — we make every
                                    element feel like you.<br>
                                     Responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to any device—mobiles, tablets, desktops—without compromising on style or

                                     Interactive elements and animations where it makes sense—not just for show, but to enhance clarity and enjoyment.<br>

                                     Secure, reliable server-side systems. Databases, APIs, content management, custom features—whatever you need behind
                                    the scenes.<br>
                                     Maintenance and scalability: your site should grow with you, not hold you back.<br>
                                    <br>
                                     Performance, Security & SEO<br>

                                     Optimisation for fast loading times (think: image compression, minimized scripts, smart caching).<br>
                                     Security best practices—SSL, safe authentication, defending against common threats.<br>
                                     Built with SEO fundamentals in mind (meta tags, valid markup, semantic structure) so your site gets noticed by search
                                    engines.<br>
                                    <br>

                                     Training, support, documentation—so you know what’s going on under the hood, and how to keep things running smoothly.<br>

                                     How We Work<br>
                                    <br>
                                    1. Discovery & Strategy<br>
                                    We start by listening. Understanding your goals, your audience, your competitors—and what you want your site to achieve.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    2. Design & Feedback<br>
                                    Wireframes, mockups, style guides…we get your input early. We iterate with you to refine the look and feel until it
                                    feels right.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    3. Development & Testing<br>
                                    Building the site, integrating functionalities, ensuring compatibility across browsers/devices. Testing for performance
                                    and security.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    4. Launch & Beyond<br>
                                    Deployment, monitoring, analytics setup. After launch, we stick around—updates, optimisations, and evolving your site as
                                    your needs grow.<br>
